To mitigate this issue, you can add a check after taking the picture to get the actual dimensions of the image. Then you can adjust your image processing or display logic based on the actual dimensions.  This isn't a perfect solution, as it requires extra processing, but it's a way to improve the robustness of your application.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// ... other code

const takePicture = async () => {
  if (cameraRef.current) {
    try {
      const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
      // Check actual dimensions
      const { width, height } = photo.width, photo.height; 
      // Handle and adjust image based on actual dimensions
      console.log('Actual Image Dimensions:', { width, height });
      setImage(photo.uri);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
    }
  }
};

```
