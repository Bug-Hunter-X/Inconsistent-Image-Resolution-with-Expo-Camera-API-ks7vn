This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom resolutions.  The issue is that even when specifying a resolution that should be supported by the device, the Camera component might return an image with unexpected dimensions. This inconsistency in returned image size makes it difficult to reliably process images in applications that depend on accurate dimensions. This is especially problematic when needing precise image sizes for features like cropping or uploading images to a server that requires specific image dimensions.
